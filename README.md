# Moodle Twitter card local plugin
This Moodle local plugin emits a Twitter summary card for courses.

The Twitter Summary Card in the course homepage will give kind of preview of the content of your Moodle course by using the information provided by mean of:
- the course title
- the course description
- an optional image, being the first added in Section #0. Beware that this image should be publicly available regardless the user being enrolled into that course

- https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/markup

# Requirements
- Moodle 3.3 (build 2017051500 or later)

# Installation
To install using _git_, type this command in the root of your Moodle installation:
```
git clone git://github.com/scara/moodle-local_twittercard.git ./local/twittercard
```
Then add `/local/twittercard` to your `gitignore` or local `exclude` files, e.g.:
```
echo '/local/twittercard' >> .git/info/exclude
```
Alternatively, download the _tar.gz_/_zip_ respectively from:
- https://github.com/scara/moodle-local_twittercard/tarball/master
- https://github.com/scara/moodle-local_twittercard/zipball/master

and uncompress it into the `local` folder.
Then rename the new folder into `twittercard`.

Log into your Moodle instance as _admin_: the installation process will start.
Alternatively, visit the _Site administration > Notifications_ page.

After you have installed this local plugin, you'll need to configure it under
_Site administration -> Plugins -> Local plugins -> Twitter card_ in the _Settings_ block.

# Performances
- Creating the card, e.g. when extracting the first image in section 0, requires a bit of computation.

# Known issues
- The first image added into section 0 of a course must be publicly accessible.
- This plugin doesn't automagically log the
[Twitterbot](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started#url-crawling-caching)
User-Agent (`"Twitterbot/1.0"`) in ([yet](https://github.com/scara/moodle-local_twittercard/issues/10)) so you need
to take care of guest access in those courses exposed via a Twitter card.
More details at [MDL-61586](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-61586).
# TODO
- Investigate the opportunity to implement more Twitter cards.
